					<h2>How Blockchain Cuts Costs for Financial Institutions</h2>

					<img class="d-block mx-auto my-4" src="img/article_9.1.gif">

					<p>Four years before Bitcoin launched, the late Dr. Stephen Hawking wrote the handbook on how financial institutions should handle the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies.</p>
					<p>“Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change,” he said. Okay, it was not a handbook, and clearly, Hawking was not talking about cryptocurrencies. However, it was terrific advice, nonetheless. When Blockchain launched, its intent was to break up the monopoly of the financial establishment. Today, companies within that same financial establishment are investing billions in researching blockchain’s potential and develop new blockchain-based systems and applications. While there’s a little fear and skepticism, there’s a lot more excitement and adaptation.</p>
					<p>Some of the financial establishment’s skepticism is well-founded. Blockchain is certainly spawning some questionable new businesses, as well as a host of offerings with incredible potential. But they also know the technology offers them a lot of the solutions they need. Arguably their greatest immediate need is the ability to trade cryptocurrencies, and generally participate in the cross-border, open-source money movement, in a safe and compliant way. A BarclayHedge survey of hedge fund managers in September 2017 revealed that 24% of hedge funds either currently invest in cryptocurrency or plan to invest within the next six months. However, many hedge funds lack the IT infrastructure for trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
					<p>But beyond the exchanges, blockchain technology has the potential to streamline transactions, improve compliance, reduce risk, decentralize tasks — and dramatically cut costs. In fact, some of the estimated savings quoted in reports are truly staggering. Santander estimates that blockchain-based apps could potentially cut costs by up to $20 billion a year by 2022. Meanwhile, an Accenture & McLagan report concludes that blockchain technology could slash costs by 70% on central finance reporting; 50% on business and central operations; 50% on compliance; and more than 30% across the middle and back offices.</p>
					<p>There are many different tasks for which blockchain technology could lower costs. It could dramatically reduce the maintenance and replacement costs associated with aging IT infrastructure. Additionally, it could simplify and speed up the transfer of payments, particularly across international borders. It could improve the accuracy of trades and shorten the duration of the conciliation and settlement processes. Also, it could execute smart contracts securely, eliminating unnecessary legal transactions. It could simplify online identity management. Plus it could streamline verification and fraud analysis. Of course, it could aid regulatory compliance.</p>
					<p>“Investment banks spend an estimated two-thirds of their IT budgets on legacy back-office infrastructure,” said David Treat, managing director of Accenture Financial Services and blockchain lead, in the Accenture & McLagan report. “Blockchain could lead banks to decommission much of that infrastructure and externalize key operational processes. It could completely change the cost dynamics in these organizations.”</p>
					<p>So what’s holding back the institutions? For a start, replacing entire legacy systems at the enterprise level would be a massive project and the high cost would likely be prohibitive, particularly since most organizations run on mainframe systems. The notion of decentralizing trust would represent a major step, requiring the creation of vast and secure networks. Given that blockchain is still an emerging technology, there are obvious concerns around performance, scalability, security and the lack of regulation.</p>
					<p>Some have suggested that blockchain technology might actually lead to more expensive transactions, given the number of network nodes required to complete the process. Meanwhile, other potential “hidden” costs include the high energy requirements of the network and the cost of lifetime data storage. In fact, a recent Forbes article criticized the Accenture estimates for failing to take into account these “exploding future costs.”</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, most institutions are at the very least experimenting with ways to harness blockchain. More than 40 global banks are actively studying the technology via the R3 Distributed Ledger Group consortium. And although a few large global banks are funneling resources towards patenting their own blockchain-based systems, most of those that do run a blockchain system partnered with a FinTech company.</p>
					<p>This month, our company, BCT, is excited to launch a cost-effective blockchain solution for hedge funds and other financial institutions, called The Blockchain Terminal.</p>
					<p>The Terminal is a one-stop desktop interface that integrates all the tools and information needed to trade cryptocurrencies, with great security and compliance. Comprising two 38-inch curved screens, BCT offers an information feed, aggregating news, and data from cryptocurrency exchanges and 1,400 crypto currencies, plus ICO info and updates from 40,000 media outlets. It also provides advanced trading data analytics and charting tools for all strategies, and it offers an open app store for institutions.</p>
					<p>Importantly, the Blockchain Terminal comes with proven, gold-standard compliance monitoring and audit trail technology, ComplianceGuard, that fulfills even the strictest hedge fund requirements. Powered exclusively by BCT utility tokens, the Terminal is currently being piloted at 20 hedge funds and will launch officially by the end of Q1.</p>
					<p>There’s little doubt that blockchain technology holds the potential to transform the way financial institutions operate, beyond the crypto exchanges, resulting in significant potential cost-savings across numerous different departments and functions. As companies become increasingly comfortable with the new technology, the use of blockchain-based apps among the institutions is likely to continue to grow.</p>

				</ol>
				
				<p class="mb-0"><b>4. Other.</b></p>
				<ol class="license-list">
					<li>BCT Credits. BCT Credits are store credits that can only be applied towards App Fees in the Blockchain Terminal.  The BCT Credits are usable only in the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis, to BCT Tokens used in the Blockchain Terminal.   BCT Credits may not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency.  When BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary market the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT Tokens shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee.  BCT Credits maybe transferred to other users within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user on transfer. Neither BCT Cayman nor the Licensor is responsible for any lost or stolen BCT Credits or use without Licensee’s permission. BCT Credits are not for resale, and no refunds or exchanges are allowed (except for a refund pursuant to Section 4(b)), and they are void where prohibited or restricted by law. Data collection and use in connection with the issuance of BCT Credits is subject to BCT’s Privacy Policy; see BCT.io/privacy, unless otherwise provided. The Licensor, and affiliates, make no warranties, express or implied, with respect to BCT Credits and disclaim any warranty to the fullest extent available.

Use of BCT Credit is governed by the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. To check the available BCT Credit balance, Licensee should refer to its Blockchain Terminal. BCT Credits may be purchased with or through the Blockchain Terminal.  When the Licensee clicks an “I Agree” or “Confirm” button, check box or other indicator of agreement presented with this Agreement on the Licensor Website, and the Licensee selects to purchase BCT with the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor is purchasing BCT Credits, not BCT Tokens.  The BCT are intended to be utilized solely within the Blockchain Terminal. The Licensor reserves right to conduct due diligence, KYC or AML with respect to the Licensee at any time.</li>
					<li>Use of BCT Tokens or BCT Credits.  When BCT Tokens or BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, a 50% discount shall apply (e.g. similar to the Binance [BNB] token ecosystem).</li>
					<li>The price of BCT Credit and BCT Tokens, for purposes of this Agreement, is fixed at $0.10 per BCT until the May 1, 2019 (i.e. the end of the restrictive period for certain BCT Tokens). The Licensor reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to issue bonus BCT Credits when BCT and the Blockchain Terminal are purchased together.  The Licensee shall have the right to obtain a full refund of the BCT Credits that are purchased along with the Blockchain Terminal if the Licensee shall terminate this Agreement within 60 days of the Effective Date as provided in Section 2(b). The refund shall be proportional to the BCT Credits being returned to the Licensor. The Licensee may request a refund in USD, Bitcoin or Ether.</li>
					<li>Licensee must maintain a minimum balance of BCT Tokens or BCT Credits in the Blockchain Terminal in order to use the Blockchain Terminal (the “Minimum BCT Balance”). The Minimum BCT Balance is 3,000 BCT Tokens or BCT Credits, and is subject to change.
