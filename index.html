						<p class="fz-25">BCT raised $31 million in its 2018 ICO. The majority of those funds were applied to development of what we believe to be the most advanced cryptocurrency trading platform in existence. Eight individual programming teams from around the world contributed to terminal software, all in a quest to bring this ambitious vision to fruition, in the shortest possible time.  Blockchain Terminal is the culmination of an aggressive, fast-moving development methodology, which results in an advancement of cryptocurrency as a whole.</p>

The BCT Credits are usable only in the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis, to BCT Tokens used in the Blockchain Terminal.   BCT Credits may not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency.  When BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary market the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT Tokens shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee.  BCT Credits maybe transferred to other users within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user on transfer.

The Licensee shall have the right to obtain a full refund of the BCT Credits that are purchased along with the Blockchain Terminal if the Licensee shall terminate this Agreement within 60 days of the Effective Date as provided in Section 2(b).

Each Contributor shall receive a number of BCT Gift Certificates equal to the contribution amount divided by $1,000 (rounded up).
