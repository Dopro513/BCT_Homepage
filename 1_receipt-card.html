					<p>BCT Credits (“BCT Credits”) are store credits that can only be applied towards fees charged with respect to the
						ecosystem of applications (“App Fees”) available on the Blockchain Terminal. The BCT Credits are usable only in
						the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis, to the digital tokens (“BCT Tokens”) issued by
						BCT Inc SEZC, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“BCT Cayman”) used in the Blockchain Terminal. BCT Credits may
						not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency. The Blockchain Terminal is managed and licensed by BCT Inc, a Saint
						Vincent and the Grenadines company (“Licensor”), and the users of the Blockchain Terminal are the “Licensees”.
						When BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary
						market the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT
						Tokens shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee. BCT Credits may be transferred to other
						users within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user upon transfer. Neither
						BCT Cayman nor the Licensor is responsible for any lost or stolen BCT Credits or use without the permission of the
						Licensee. BCT Credits are not for resale, and no refunds or exchanges are allowed (except for a 60 day money back
						guarantee for BCT Credits purchased with a Blockchain Terminal), and they are void where prohibited or restricted
						by law. Data collection and use in connection with the issuance of BCT Credits is subject to the Licensor’s
						Privacy Policy; see BCT.io/privacy, unless otherwise provided. The Licensor, and affiliates, make no warranties,
						express or implied, with respect to BCT Credits and disclaim any warranty to the fullest extent available. BCT
						Credit terms and conditions are subject to change without notice. Please visit <a href="http://www.bct.io/bct-credit-terms">www.bct.io/bct-credit-terms</a>
						for current terms, conditions, and limitations. Use of BCT Credit is governed by the laws of Saint Vincent and the
						Grenadines. To check the available BCT Credit balance, Licensee should refer to its Blockchain Terminal. BCT
						Credits may be purchased with or through the Blockchain Terminal. When the Licensee clicks an “I Agree” or
						“Confirm” button, check box or other indicator of agreement presented with this agreement on the Licensor website,
						and the Licensee selects to purchase “BCT” with the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor is purchasing BCT Credits,
						not BCT Tokens. BCT is a utility, not a security. Furthermore, the Blockchain Terminal and BCT are inseparable
						components of the Blockchain Terminal. BCT can only be transferred or used within the Blockchain Terminal. The
						Licensor reserves right to conduct due diligence, KYC or AML at anytime.</p>

					<p class="mb-0"><b>Term.</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>This Agreement shall be effective from the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter
							for the term selected by the Licensee on the Licensor Website, or if no term is selected, then the term shall be

							return of the Equipment, the Licensee shall be entitled for a full refund, less expenses.</li>

							Terminal. The BCT Credits are usable only in the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis,
							to BCT Tokens used in the Blockchain Terminal. BCT Credits may not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency. When
							BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary market
							the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT Tokens
							shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee. BCT Credits maybe transferred to other users
							within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user on transfer. Neither BCT
							Cayman nor the Licensor is responsible for any lost or stolen BCT Credits or use without Licensee’s permission.

							issuance of BCT Credits is subject to BCT’s Privacy Policy; see BCT.io/privacy, unless otherwise provided. The

							governed by the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. To check the available BCT Credit balance, Licensee
							should refer to its Blockchain Terminal. BCT Credits may be purchased with or through the Blockchain Terminal.
							When the Licensee clicks an “I Agree” or “Confirm” button, check box or other indicator of agreement presented
							with this Agreement on the Licensor Website, and the Licensee selects to purchase BCT with the Blockchain
							Terminal, the Licensor is purchasing BCT Credits, not BCT Tokens. BCT is a utility, not a security. Furthermore,
							the Blockchain Terminal and BCT are inseparable components of the Blockchain Terminal. BCT can only be
							transferred or used within the Blockchain Terminal. The Licensor reserves right to conduct due diligence, KYC or
							AML at anytime.</li>

							bonus BCT Credits when BCT and Blockchain Terminal are purchased together. The Licensee shall have the right to
							obtain a full refund of the BCT Credits that are purchased along with the Blockchain Terminal if the Licensee
							shall terminate this Agreement within 60 days of the Effective Date as provided in Section 2(b). The refund shall
							be proportional to the BCT Credits being returned to the Licensor. The Licensee may request a refund in USD,
							Bitcoin or Ether.</li>
						<li>Licensee must maintain a minimum balance of BCT Tokens or BCT Credits in the Blockchain Terminal in order to
							use the Blockchain Terminal (the “Minimum BCT Balance”). The Minimum BCT Balance is 3,000 BCT Tokens or BCT
							Credits, and is subject to change. The Minimum BCT Balance is determined at the sole discretion of the Licensee,
							and is a function the number of Apps on the Blockchain Terminal, number of users, and other variables. The
							Minimum BCT Balance is capped at 100,000 BCT Tokens or BCT Credits.</li>

							the Licensor, and can only be applied toward the purchase of the Blockchain Terminal. The BCT Gift Certificate
							provides a $1,000 face value to the holder of the certificate. Each Contributor shall receive a number of BCT

							Terminal and requires BCT Tokens for App Fees, the Contributor who assigned the Gift Certificates to the Gift
							Users shall have a first right of refusal to transfer the Gift Users BCT Tokens up to an aggregate amount of BCT
							Tokens purchased by such Contributor through token sale event of BCT Cayman, provided that such transfer process
							shall be conducted through the Licensor and subject to the Licensor’s terms and conditions. The BCT Gift
							Certificate may be applied to the purchase of Blockchain Terminal or to the BCT purchased with the Blockchain
							Terminal, as determined by the Licensor at its absolute discretion. The Licensor makes no warranties, express or
							implied, with respect to BCT Gift Certificates, and disclaim any warranty to the fullest extent available. BCT
							Gift Certificate terms and conditions are subject to change without notice. Please visit

						its suppliers or third party agents shall be responsible or liable, contingently or otherwise, for any personal
						injury or property damage arising out of the Installation, relocation, maintenance, use or removal of the
						Equipment.</p>

							assignment or transfer shall relieve Licensor of its obligations hereunder.</li>
						<li>Licensee shall not assign this Agreement or any interests hereunder and shall not enter into any sublease with
							respect to the Equipment covered hereby without Licensor's and the Assignee's prior written consent, which
							consent shall not be unreasonable withheld.</li>

						statement of the agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any oral
						or written communications or representations or agreements relating thereto. No changes, modifications, waivers or
