					<p>BCT Credits (“BCT Credits”) are store credits that can only be applied towards fees charged with respect to the ecosystem of applications (“App Fees”) available on the Blockchain Terminal.  The BCT Credits are usable only in the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis, to the digital tokens (“BCT Tokens”) issued by BCT Inc SEZC, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“BCT Cayman”) used in the Blockchain Terminal.   BCT Credits may not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency.  The Blockchain Terminal is managed and licensed by BCT Inc, a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines company (“Licensor”), and the users of the Blockchain Terminal are the “Licensees”. When BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary market the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT Tokens shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee.  BCT Credits may be transferred to other users within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user upon transfer. Neither BCT Cayman nor the Licensor is responsible for any lost or stolen BCT Credits or use without the permission of the Licensee. BCT Credits are not for resale, and no refunds or exchanges are allowed (except for a 60 day money back guarantee for BCT Credits purchased with a Blockchain Terminal), and they are void where prohibited or restricted by law. Data collection and use in connection with the issuance of BCT Credits is subject to the Licensor’s Privacy Policy; see BCT.io/privacy, unless otherwise provided. The Licensor, and affiliates, make no warranties, express or implied, with respect to BCT Credits and disclaim any warranty to the fullest extent available. BCT Credit terms and conditions are subject to change without notice. Please visit <a href="http://www.bct.io/bct-credit-terms">www.bct.io/bct-credit-terms</a> for current terms, conditions, and limitations. Use of BCT Credit is governed by the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. To check the available BCT Credit balance, Licensee should refer to its Blockchain Terminal. BCT Credits may be purchased with or through the Blockchain Terminal.  When the Licensee clicks an “I Agree” or “Confirm” button, check box or other indicator of agreement presented with this agreement on the Licensor website, and the Licensee selects to purchase “BCT” with the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor is purchasing BCT Credits, not BCT Tokens. BCT is a utility, not a security.  Furthermore, the Blockchain Terminal and BCT are inseparable components of the Blockchain Terminal. BCT can only be transferred or used within the Blockchain Terminal. The Licensor reserves right to conduct due diligence, KYC or AML at anytime.</p>
