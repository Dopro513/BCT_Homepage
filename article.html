					<p>Crypto trading seems to be easy, in some ways. You hop on an exchange, set your price, buy or sell, and repeat until you have something you want to keep in a hardware wallet.</p>
					<p>But what we see, isn’t necessarily what is.</p>
					<p>We see an exchange. We see a price. We see a demand, and a supply. We hope to be on the right end of that seesaw. But what we cannot do, is understand the entire cryptocurrency market – the 100 or more exchanges, the tens of thousands of buy and sell orders beyond our immediate grasp. Even if we could load them individually, even if we had gone through the painstaking process of KYC for every one of those exchanges… we could never switch between them quickly enough to use the information we had worked so hard for.</p>
					<p>What we see, is not necessarily what is.</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>From Compliance To Cryptocurrency </h3>
					<p>Blockchain Terminal (BCT) has been under development for three years – initially, through its ComplianceGuard product, which provides a means of providing traditional Hedge Funds and smaller investment companies with information related to audit trails, business rule logic, and exception alerts (as a blatant example, imagine that a fund is precluded from investing in a certain country, and then ignores the embargo – an exception alert would catch this kind of activity).</p>
					<p>CEO Bob Bonomo, a veteran Wall Street insider with experience as the CIO at OppenheimerFunds and AllianceBernstein, describes the original product as a “good housekeeping seal” for smaller funds to gain access to asset ow. “When I joined the company, I saw that our foundational capability was in transparency, accountability, compliance… and I saw the relevance for the crypto world, where we have nothing, no auditors, no regulators.”</p>
					<p>Over a period of several minutes, Bonomo outlines almost every problem facing the institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as an asset class – metrics, exchange volume issues, reliability, custody solutions, education – and he quotes Mike Novogratz’s famous “The herd is coming…” to illustrate that these issues need to be resolved, and quickly.</p>
					<p>The upshot of this, is that Blockchain Terminal was designed from the ground-up with compliant institutional investors in mind. <i><b>But there’s a surprise in store for home crypto enthusiasts, too</b> (read all the way to the bottom…)</i></p>

					<hr>

					<h3>Everything About Crypto Trading Changes Now </h3>
					<p>Back in Miami, where I rst encountered the product, I saw some interesting features. In New York, a look at the progress since January brought the concept home, and made me realize that crypto trading is about to change completely.</p>
					<p>The Blockchain Terminal itself looks cool. I don’t know how else to say this. It’s cool. A pair of ultrawide monitors stacked vertically, covered with information – mostly familiar, but never presented in one single interface before –  and all of which is very… cool. The hardware is almost as engaging as the software.</p>
					<p>The user experience is vital when it comes to driving a sports car, or playing a video game – why not create something just as dynamic and immersive for crypto trading? Sitting down at this device makes me want to crack my knuckles, loosen my ngers. It feels like getting down to business.</p>
					<p>The Blockchain Terminal fullls several functions: </p>

					<h3>Exchange Integration</h3>
					<p>The project aims to include dozens of exchanges with a consolidated order book. When ordinary crypto traders, most of us, make a trade on an exchange we are seeing one fragment of the crypto universe. But Blockchain Terminal brings almost the entire ecosystem into one place. So instead of being presented with THIS order, on THIS exchange, your order book shows ALL orders across ALL supported exchanges – and allows you to buy, or sell, at the best available rate.</p>
					<p>And that’s not all. You want to buy 20 ETH of Quantstamp today? You’ll have to go through a pretty signicant range on any individual exchange to buy at market rate. But the consolidated order you place through Blockchain Terminal will actually spread your buy across all supported exchanges, buying 20 ETH at the lowest possible rate <i>even if it buys a fraction on Binance, a fraction on Huobi, a fraction on a dozen other exchanges…</i> and delivering the resulting QSP to a consolidated wallet. Seamlessly obtaining a price that you couldn’t humanly obtain on your own.</p>
					<p>As for your wallet, it acts as any other wallet – you load it, you transfer the tokens, you buy and sell, you save your favorites to your hardware device. One wallet, with access to the entire cryptoverse.</p>
					<p>And all of this gives rise to an obvious question: how do you register on all of these exchanges?</p>
					<p>And the answer is – you don’t. The KYC and registration is handled by BCT as an entity: you complete KYC with them once, and then you have access to their entire portfolio of exchanges.</p>
					<p><i>Yes, read this whole section again. Does the headline make sense now? </i></p>

					<h3>Blockchain Terminal App Store</h3>
					<p>The whole system is designed around the app concept – when I sat down with the team for a second demonstration, the store had come to life. In the top right, a ‘tag cloud’ style app illustrating the relative increase or decrease in value of a set of cryptocurrencies, as well as their relative volume. Clever, engaging, effective.</p>
					<p>Other apps track ICO cash ow, calendars, self-curated news ows, sentiment analytics… in fact, as Bonomo continued, the company sees their success as “all about partnerships” . Developers will be encouraged to create nancial apps, either for use in-house by the institution, or for sale to all users via the token ecosystem. “We anticipate revenue share of 80% to the developer,” says Bonomo.</p>
					<p>The entire interface is customizable, giving crypto traders access to almost everything they could conceivably want or need to execute their business without leaving the environment.</p>
					<p>It is stunning. The UI is simply stunning. And although the team test-drove it for me, I could see that with a little practice, the UX would be equally remarkable.</p>

					<div class="text-center mb-3">
						<img src="img/article-pic.jpg" alt="">
					</div>

					<h3>Private Ethereum Fork For Compliance </h3>
					<p>The original ComplianceGuard product is also part of the suite; it captures the trading data to ensure that professional funds remain within their remit: “It’s there to identify attempts to deviate from the constraints and mandate that’s sold to the client,” says Bonomo. For funds looking to ensure compliance, the system is essentially designed to prevent the terrifying ‘rogue trader’ scenario which could expose them to nancial risk and legal jeopardy – while also allowing investors to sleep easy, knowing their money is being put to use as promised by the fund.</p>
					<p>The way compliance audits are done today, says Bonomo, “is like a reman entering a burned-out building” . It’s all done as a post-mortem. But this system, with its live alerts, could help prevent the kind of events that bring entire industries to their knees: “We can prevent the kind of Madoff situations that show up every ten years, and paint a very negative picture of the industry.”</p>
					<p>And that’s one of the key factors behind adding genuine compliance to this product – it actively encourages the institutional investor to test the cryptocurrency waters. Bonomo explains that “No crypto hedge funds that I know of have a constriction management capability, like you can only trade these eight pairs – and when you deviate from that, it’s captured, and someone’s going to ask why you did it.”</p>

					<hr>

					<h3>The Future Of Crypto Trading </h3>
					<p>Technology is supposed to be an enabler.</p>
					<p>Sometimes it fails. Bad design, unanticipated consequences, poor management.</p>
					<p>What I see here is the real deal. It will not only allow for better decision-making, more protable trading, more accurate execution – but it will also encourage further adoption from the investment people who have been skeptical of crypto trading, with good reason. More institutional money in crypto is not a bad thing, it’s simply that with their algorithms and trading platforms and articial intelligence, it often means the ordinary Joes are competing in a game they can’t win.</p>
					<p>But I promised a surprise for home cryptotrading enthusiasts, too – and here it is.</p>
					<p>Blockchain Terminal is provided as a full hardware suite, as I mentioned…</p>

					<h3>They’re also releasing a fully-functioned web app.</h3>
					<p>So it’s not just for those who are already bored of their own Lambo – the rest of us will get to use the Blockchain Terminal crypto trading suite too. You may have to switch screens a little more, but I was told that all the functionality of the hardware setup will be available to (I assume) subscribers.</p>
					<p>At the time of writing, there are no details on availability or price – but there is a signup form…</p>

			<p class="outro">© 2018 BCT Inc - All rights reserved. BCT Inc, a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines company, is the developer of Blockchain Terminal, an institutional-grade cryptocurrency platform and app store that unites traditional investment with the emerging cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain Terminal users will purchase apps and crypto-trading tools developed by third-party blockchain developers using BCT tokens. BCT Inc has a non-profit mandate and is a wholly owned Cayman subsidiary of the BCT Foundation, a non-profit Cayman Islands foundation. Use of the Blockchain Terminal is governed by its <a class="underline" target="_blank" data-toggle="modal" href="#license-agreement">License Agreement</a>. App prices are set by each app developer and range from freemium apps, one-time purchase, monthly recurring, to pay-per-use. Terminal users may choose which apps they are interested in using based on the price/value of each app, however, users must maintain a minimum balance of BCT in order to login to their account. The minimum BCT balance was set by the BCT Inc on November 1, 2018 at 3,000 BCT. The Minimum BCT balance is a function of the number of apps on Blockchain Terminal, number of users, and other variables;  and it is capped at 100,000 BCT. The Blockchain Terminal and BCT are two inseparable components of a single product (like a Jukebox and Jukebox tokens which are required to play songs). BCT is used in a similar manner to Binance’s BNB (users currently receive a 50% discount on trading fees, custodian fees and apps when paying with BCT). The price of BCT is currently fixed at $0.10, however A one-time-discount is offered at the time a terminal is purchased. Like the terminal, the purchase of BCT is covered by our no-questions-asked, 60-day money back guarantee. For example: a $10,000 purchase of 100,000 BCT+40,000 Bonus BCT entitles the purchaser to return 140,000 BCT for refund of $10,000. A partial return of 70,000 BCT entitles the purchaser to a refund of $5,000. Users may request their refund in USD, BTC, or ETH.</p>

					<p class="mb-0"><b>Term.</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>This Agreement shall be effective from the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter for the term selected by the Licensee on the Licensor Website, or if no term is selected, then the term shall be monthly (the “Term”).</li>
						<li>The Licensee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within 60 days of the Effective Date. Upon the return of the Equipment, the Licensee shall be entitled for a full refund, less expenses.</li>
						<li>The Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time, upon not less than 10 days prior written notice to the other party.</li>

					</ul>
					
					<p class="mb-0"><b>Charges.</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>“Blockchain Terminal Fee”: As selected by the Licensee on the Licensor Website.</li>
						<li>“Monthly Service Fee”: As indicated or selected by the Licensee on the Licensor Website. If the amount of Monthly Service Fee is not indicated on the Licensor Website, then the Monthly Service Fee shall be $0. If there is a change in the Monthly Service Fee, the Licensee shall be notified and will have 10 calendar days to accept any such change.  If payment is by credit card, then the Licensee shall provide to Licensor on the Licensor Website such credit card information as shall be necessary to establish an automatic monthly credit card payment for the Monthly Service Fee, and the Monthly Service Fee shall be paid accordingly.</li>
						<li>The Licensee shall pay the Monthly Service Fee to the Licensor on the payment date as established on the Licensor Website (the “Payment Date”) for the duration of the Term.  The first and last month payments shall be prorated, as applicable.  Interest on any past due payments under this Agreement shall accrue at the rate of 2% per month, or if such rate shall exceed the maximum rate allowed by law, then at such maximum rate, and shall be payable on demand.  Licensee agrees that failure to pay the Monthly Service Fee by the Payment Date shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, and upon such breach where the Licensee is more than 5 days late with its payment, Licensor or its assignee may terminate the Agreement.</li>
						<li>The Blockchain Terminal provides Licensee access to an ecosystem of applications (“Apps”) (similar to an app store), for which the Licensee maybe charged an “App Fee”, payable in BCT Tokens or BCT Credits.  The App Fee for each App is determined by the App developer, and may be structured as: freemium apps, one-time purchase, monthly recurring, pay-per-use, per transaction, or otherwise. The Licensee shall be charged the App Fee for the Apps the Licensee uses or subscribes to.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="mb-0"><b>Other.</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>BCT Credits. BCT Credits are store credits that can only be applied towards App Fees in the Blockchain Terminal.  The BCT Credits are usable only in the Blockchain Terminal, and are equivalent, on a one-to-one basis, to BCT Tokens used in the Blockchain Terminal.   BCT Credits may not be redeemed for cash or cryptocurrency.  When BCT Credits are used for App Fees on the Blockchain Terminal, the Licensor shall purchase in the secondary market the same number of BCT Tokens as the number of BCT Credits used for the App Fees, and these purchased BCT Tokens shall be used as payment for the App Fees on behalf the Licensee.  BCT Credits maybe transferred to other users within the Blockchain Terminal. Risk of loss and title for BCT Credits pass to user on transfer. Neither BCT Cayman nor the Licensor is responsible for any lost or stolen BCT Credits or use without Licensee’s permission.
